        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="mt-6 text-sm leading-relaxed text-[#DDD6FE]">
        I am a cybersecurity-focused software developer with a strong interest
        in system architecture, secure application design, and problem-solving
        at the intersection of software and security.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-[#DDD6FE]">
        I enjoy working close to the system level — understanding how software
        behaves under real-world constraints, identifying security risks, and
        building solutions that are reliable, efficient, and secure by design.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-[#C4B5FD]">
        My goal is to continuously grow as an engineer while building
        technology that prioritizes security, performance, and long-term
        reliability.
